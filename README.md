# Budget-Tracker
This Budget App allows users to manage their expenses by adding and tracking them against an initial budget.
Users can add expenses with descriptions and amounts, and view detailed budget information, including total expenses and remaining balance. The app saves and loads budget data from a JSON file, ensuring data persistence. The main functionalities include adding expenses, displaying budget details, and exiting the application. The script uses functions for modular operations and handles potential file errors gracefully.
